# Example incident

## Creating the incident

Let's say Acme Corporation has an issue and their online "ACME store" goes down. They would immediately go to their status blog and create an incident to indicate that they are investigating the issue, and check that the "ACME store" is one of the components affected, settings that components status to **Major outage**.

### How the active incident appears on the blog

When the incident is created, it will appear at the top of the Acme Coporation's status blog.

## Updating the incident

Once they found the root cause, they would update their incident with a new status and message, adding any relevant details.

They would deploy a fix and issue an update saying they have done so, and monitor their systems to ensure things go back to normal.

And when confident that all things are back to normal, would finally resolve and close out the incident. They would additionally set the affected component status back to **Operational**.

### How the resolved incident appears on the blog

Once the incident has been resolved, it would not longer show up at the top of the status blog. It would show up in the **Past incidents** section towards the bottom.
