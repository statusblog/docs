# Create your first status blog

When your [account is registered](/get-started/register-for-an-account) and verified, you will be directed to a page to create your first status blog. Here you simply need to choose a name for your blog and the subdomain it will be hosted at.

## Choose your blog name

The name should be the public name of your service or business, and it will show up at the top of your status blog and email communications. For example, "My Service". 

## Choose your public subdomain

The subdomain is which subdomain your blog will be hosted at. For example, if you put in `my-service`, your status blog would be located at `my-service.statusblog.io`. 

## Finishing up 

Once you have filled in the **Blog name** and **Subdomain**, click **Create blog** to finish this step. From there, you will be redirected to the [Statusblog dashboard](/get-started/statusblog-dashboard/)
