# Manage subscribers

Subscribers are users that are subscribed to notifications from your status blog. In addition to the self-service subscribe/unsubscribe functionality that Statusblog gives to all users, the administrators can additionally manage subscribers themselves.

## Add an email subscriber

1. Go to the **Subscribers** tab in the [admin dashboard](../get-started/admin-dashboard.md).
2. Click **Add subscriber** button in the top right
3. Fill in their **Email** and click **Save** to send them a confirmation email.

### Resent email subscriber confirmation email

Subscribers do not receive notifications until they confirm their email address. Those that are not confirmed will have a **Resend confirmation** link next to their entry in the subscriber panel. Click that link to send them another confirmation email.

1. Go to the **Subscribers** tab in the [admin dashboard](../get-started/admin-dashboard.md).
2. Click **Remove** link next to the relevant subscriber.
3. Confirm the removal by clicking the **Remove** button in the confirmation dialog.

When the subscriber is removed, they will receive a notification email notifying them of being successfully unsubscribed.
