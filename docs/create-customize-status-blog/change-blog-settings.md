# Change blog settings

You can change your blog settings by navigating to the **Blog info** tab in the [statusblog dashboard](../get-started/statusblog-dashboard.md). From there, you can edit any of the relevant fields and click **Save** in the bottom right to confirm your changes.

## Name

The name should be the public name of your service or business, and it will show up at the top of your status blog and email communications. 

## Subdomain

The subdomain configured the public URL for your status blog. Each status blog is hosted at a subdomain under `statusblog.io`.

## Custom domain

If you own your own domain, you can use that as the domain for your status blog. See [add a custom domain](add-a-custom-domain.md) for more details.

## Description

The description is a description of your status page for your users. It shows at the top of your public status blog. Here you can welcome your users and explain what sort of updates are posted to the status blog.
